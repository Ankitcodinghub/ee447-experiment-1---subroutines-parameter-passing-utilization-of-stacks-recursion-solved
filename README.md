Experiment 1 ‚Äì Programming with Subroutines, Parameter Passing, Utilization of Stacks &amp; the Concept of Recursion

Objectives

A subroutine is a reusable program module. A main program can call or jump to the subroutine one or more times. The stack is used in several ways when subroutines are called. Stack is an abstract data type that holds information in the memory and it is used in several ways especially when subroutines are called. Recall that until now, you have not been able to call a subroutine inside a subroutine, since you lose the address where the main program is left. With the utilization of stacks, you will be able to program with nested subroutines and moreover, you can implement recursive functions. In this lab you will learn:

‚Ä¢ How to write subroutines and call them from the main program

‚Ä¢ Ways to pass parameters to and from subroutines

‚Ä¢ How to create flowcharts and develop pseudo-codes

‚Ä¢ The function of the stack and the stack pointer

‚Ä¢ Ways to pass parameters to and from stack

‚Ä¢ Understanding of the hierarchy within a code

‚Ä¢ Use of nested subroutines

‚Ä¢ The concept of recursive programming

1 Background Information

1.1 Subroutines

A subroutine is a program module that is separate from the main or calling program. Frequently the subroutine is called by the main program many times, but the code for the subroutine only needs to be written once. When a subroutine is called, program control is transferred from the main program to the subroutine. When the subroutine finishes executing, control is returned to the main program. Using subroutines saves memory, but a greater benefit is improved program organization. In future labs, you will find it beneficial to use subroutines for various functions of your programs.

1.2 Calling Subroutines

You will recall, the program counter, or register PC (R15), always contains the address of the next instruction to be executed in a program. Calling a subroutine is similar to an unconditional branch as the program jumps to a different address other than the next address. The difference is that when the subroutine finishes executing, control goes back to the instruction after the subroutine call in the main program. A BL instruction causes the address of the next memory instruction to be pushed onto R14 (Link Register or LR) and the argument of BL to be loaded into the program counter. The argument of BL is the starting address of the subroutine. But, when you write your program, you just give it a name and the assembler figures out the rest. At the end of a subroutine, the instruction BX LR causes what was last stored in LR to be loaded into the program counter. In this way, the instruction after the BL in the main program is the next one executed. Therefore, it is important to recall that your subroutine should end with Branch and link with eXchance of the address stored in the Link Register, i.e., BX LR.

1.3 Coding with Subroutines

;LABEL DIRECTIVE VALUE COMMENT

AREA THUMB routines , CODE, READONLY

EXPORT Routine name ; make it available

; to other sources

Routine name PROC

. . . . . . ; your routine

BX LR ; return

An example of a main program coding with subroutines placed in separate files can be:

;LABEL DIRECTIVE VALUE COMMENT

AREA THUMB main , CODE, READONLY

EXTERN Routine name ; Reference external subroutine

; IMPORT can also be used

EXPORT main

ENTRY ; execution starts from here

main PROC

. . . . . . ; your code

BL Routine name ; call to your subroutine

. . .

ENDP . . .

If the subroutine and the main program are placed in the same source file, then EXPORT and EXTERN directives can be omitted.

1.4 Parameter Passing

A parameter is passed to the subroutine by leaving the data in a register, or memory, and allowing the subroutine to use it. A parameter is passed back to the main program by allowing the subroutine to change the data. This is the way parameters are passed in assembly language. When the parameter being passed to the subroutine is in a register, this is referred to as the call-by-value technique of passing parameters. If the data is in memory and the address is passed to the subroutine, this is called call-byreference. It is important to document all parameter-passing details in subroutines.

Both stack usage and subroutine usage are crucial in order to write an efficient source code for your application. Generally, the memory of the microprocessor is limited and usage of stacks, as well as subroutines that are covered in the previous lab session, help reducing the source code length. In this lab, the experiments will be based on manipulating stack structure for parameter passing and using it to develop a program with higher hierarchy.

1.5 Stacks

Stack is an abstract data type that holds information in a LIFO (last-in-first-out) manner. For this very processor, the stack is actually just an area of memory whose highest address is in register R13 which is referred to as the stack pointer (SP). Make sure you understand the difference between the stack and the stack pointer. The stack is an area of memory; the stack pointer is the address of the last value pushed onto the stack.

Usually, the stack is used for storing data when subroutines are called. The stack is a last-in-first-out, i.e., LIFO structure so the last thing stored in the stack is the first thing retrieved. This resembles a pile of papers to be processed. The first paper put in the stack is the last paper to be processed. Whereas, the last paper put on the stack is the first paper to be processed. Another mechanical analogy that will demonstrate how the stack operates is the tissue dispensers used in bathrooms or public toilets. Figure 1-(a) illustrates a cross-section of a dispenser containing some tissues. As people use the restrooms, each person takes one or more tissues from the dispenser after washing their hands. When a tissue is removed, a mechanism moves the tissue upward so that the next tissue is at the top of the dispenser. Figures 1-(b) and 1-(c) illustrate this process. Hence, the next person to wash hands can easily access the next tissue that is now placed on top. When the janitor refills the dispenser with a pile of new tissues, the mechanism goes downward so that the last tissue to be placed into the dispenser is at the top of the dispenser, as Figure 1-(d) illustrates. If how the dispenser operates is considered, it becomes obvious that the last tissue to be placed into the dispenser is the first to be used to dry hands, thus making the device a LIFO model. The stack operates exactly as this tissue dispenser, i.e, referred as a LIFO data structure.

Figure 1: Tissue Dispenser Analogy

PUSH and POP instructions use to store and retrieve data to and from the stack, respectively. PUSH instruction stores 4-Byte register onto the stack and POP instruction stores the top 4-Byte data to the register. Recall that TM4C123GH6PM uses full descending stack. The push instruction first decrements the stack pointer by 4 and then stores 4 bytes of data, which is the content of the register, onto the stack. Consider what happens if register SP contains the address 0x2000.00FF and the register R0 contains the value 0x6B. Executing the instruction PUSH R0 first decrements the stack pointer by 4, so register SP is now 0x2000.00FA and pushes the value 0x6B onto the stack at memory location 0x2000.00FA. The POP R0 instruction first puts the contents of the top of stack into the R0 register and then increments the stack pointer by 4.

The main purpose you will be using the stack for is saving data when a subroutine is called. For example, assume your main program uses registers R0-R4. You call a subroutine that is going to calculate some value and pass it back to the main program. After you call the subroutine, you can just push all the data onto the stack before executing any instructions in the subroutine. The subroutine can then use all the registers for its internal use and store the data that the main program needs in one of the memory locations. At the end of the subroutine, you can pop the stored data from the stack and then return control to the main program. The following code is an illustrative example for that case:

;LABEL DIRECTIVE

; main program

. . . VALUE COMMENT

BL

. . .

; subroutine part my subr

my subr PUSH {R0}

PUSH {R1}

PUSH {R2}

PUSH {R3}

. . . ; subroutine instructions

POP {R3}

POP {R2}

POP {R1}

POP {R0}

BX LR

Calling a subroutine inside a subroutine, i.e. nested subroutines, can be an example to the aforementioned case as well. In that case, in order not to lose the return address information, LR should be preserved upon calling a subroutine inside a subroutine. Thus, the following code structure is a good practice if your subroutines call another subroutine:

;LABEL DIRECTIVE

; subroutine part VALUE COMMENT

sub1 PUSH {LR}

. . . ; subroutine instructions

BL sub2 ; another subroutine call

. . . ; subroutine instructions

POP {LR}

BX LR

;LABEL DIRECTIVE VALUE COMMENT

; main program

. . .

PUSH {R0}

PUSH {R1}

PUSH {R2}

PUSH {R3}

BL my subr

. . . ; some instructions to process

. . . ; registers that my subr modifies

POP {R3}

POP {R2}

POP {R1}

POP {R0}

. . . ; rest of the main program

The important thing to know when using the stack is that pushes and pops have to be used in pairs because the stack is a LIFO data structure. If you push several registers, you have to pop them off the stack in the opposite order.

1.6 Concept of Recursion

In computer science, the term recursion refers to the method where the solution to a problem depends on solutions to smaller instances of the same problem, that is, in application a function is expected to call itself within the program text. If you are unfamiliar with the concept, please do some research for broader information and coded examples.

1.7 Pseudo-code Generation

Problem: Write an assembly language source code to be executed on an MCU with two registers A and B as follows: The program should read three unsigned numbers at memory addresses 0x0000, 0x0001, and 0x0002, sort them from largest to smallest, and store them to addresses 0x0003, 0x0004, and 0x0005.

i.e. at the end of the execution, memory addresses 0x0003 and 0x0005 should contain the largest and smallest numbers respectively.

Pseudo-code: Note that this is just one algorithm to solve this problem. A and B stand for register A and register B for convenience, but they do not have to be in a pseudo-code.

A ‚Üê 1st Number (0000)

B ‚Üê 2nd Number (0001)

If A &lt; B

A ‚Üí Smallest (0005)

B ‚Üí Largest (0003)

Else

B ‚Üí Smallest

A ‚Üí Largest

A ‚Üê Largest (0003) B ‚Üê 3rd Number (0002)

If A &lt; B

B ‚Üí Largest A ‚Üí Middle (0004)

Done.

Else

B ‚Üí Middle

A ‚Üê Smallest

If A &lt; B

Done.

Else

A ‚Üí Middle

B ‚Üí Smallest

Done.

1.8 Flowcharts

A flowchart illustrates the steps in a process. It contains different symbols to indicate various tasks that the program has to do. There are many dedicated symbols for different types of tasks, but not all have to be utilized for the algorithm to be clear. In general the tasks in the regular flow are indicated by rectangular boxes, and a decision point to change the program flow (If-Then-Else, Repeat-Until) is indicated by diamonds. For example the algorithm described in the previous section can be depicted in a flowchart as below.

Figure 2: Example Flowchart for the Pseudo-code Given in 1.7

2 Preliminary Work

1. (18%) Write a subroutine, CONVRT, that converts an m-digit decimal number represented by n bits (n &lt; 32) in register R4 into such a format that the ASCII codes of the digits of its decimal equivalent would listed in the memory starting from the location address of which is stored in register R5. When printed using OutStr, the printed number is to contain no leading 0s, that is, exactly m digits should be printed for an m-digit decimal number. Before writing the subroutine, the corresponding pseudo-code or flow chart is to be generated.

Some exemplar printings (righthand side) for the corresponding register contents (lefthand side) are provided below:

R4: 0x7FFFFFFF ‚Äî 2147483647 (max. value possible)

R4: 0x0000000A ‚Äî 10 R4: 0x00000000 ‚Äî 0

3. (35%) Write a program for decimal number guessing using binary search method. The number is to be an integer in the range (0,2n), i.e. 0 &lt; number &lt; 2n, where n &lt; 32 and n is determined by a user-input. Then, the guessing phase is to be handled through a simple interface where the processor outputs its current guess in decimal base and calculate the next according to the user inputs, D standing for down, U standing for up, or C standing for correct. To fulfill the requirements given above, include the subroutine CONVRT from the Part-1 in your main program as well as a new subroutine UPBND that updates the search boundaries after each guess. Prior to writing the code itself, draw a flowchart of the main algorithm leaving the subroutine parts as black boxes.

4. (40%) Write a recursive program that computes first N elements of the mFibonacci Sequence which is a modified version of Fibonacci Sequence. The number N is to be an integer in the range (0,16) and is determined by a user-input.Then, the computation phase starts and the program computes the first N terms of a modified Fibonacci Sequence. After the computation finishes the sequence of numbers is going to be printed.

Fibonacci Sequence: The Fibonacci sequence is one of the most well-known series of numbers in mathematics that has found applications in advanced mathematics, computer science, and statistics etc.Each number in the sequence is the addition of the last two numbers, starting with 0, and 1. So, the sequence is: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, and so on. The mathematical expression describing it is;

Fn = Fn‚àí1 + Fn‚àí2 where n‚â•2.

mFibonacci Sequence: Each number in the modified Fibonacci Sequence is computed by using the mathematical expression given below;

Fn = Fn‚àí1 + 2 ‚àó Fn‚àí2 where n‚â•2, F0 = 1 and F1 = 1.

So, the sequence is: 1, 1, 3, 5, 11, 21, 43, 85, 171 and so on.

For this item, please explain how you solve the problem and draw a flowchart of your algorithm.

Please remember that the input is to be provided via Termite in decimal base and your program will calculate all the terms one by one by calling the recursive function you typed and return the output via Termite in decimal base.
